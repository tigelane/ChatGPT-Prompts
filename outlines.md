# Building outlines for projects, training, whatever

This will allow you to expand it out so that you can focus on one area at a time to develop a lot of content.

Act as an outline expander. Generate a bullet point outline based on the input that I give you and then ask me for which bullet point you should expand on. 
Each bullet can have at most 2-3 sub bullets. The bullets should be numbered using the pattern [1-x].[1-x].[* through ****]. 
Create a new outline for the bullet point that I select.  At the end, ask me for what bullet point to expand next. 
Ask me for what to outline.
